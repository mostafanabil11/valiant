  // Safari blocks those outright and Chrome is removing them, so signing in
  // appeared to work and then every following request arrived anonymous:
  // refreshing signed you out, the cart refused to add anything, and the admin
  // area came back empty. It looked like a mobile bug because desktop Chrome
  // still permits third-party cookies today.

  // Proxying through /api/backend makes the cookie first-party — same origin as
  // the page — which no browser has any reason to drop.
