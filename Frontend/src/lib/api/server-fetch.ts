// Native fetch is used instead of the axios client because only fetch hooks

// through Node's http module and bypasses that layer entirely.
//
// The deadline is the important part. A machine reaching an API that isn't
// there does not necessarily get a connection refused: if the address routes
// nowhere, or a firewall drops the packets rather than rejecting them, the
// socket simply waits. Without a deadline that wait is unbounded, every page
// rendering the layout stalls, and the build dies on a timeout that names the
// page rather than the cause. An AbortSignal turns that silence into a prompt,
// catchable error.
//
// Build and runtime want very different deadlines, and conflating them caused a
// real bug: a shared 8s limit is right for a build, where the API may genuinely
// not exist and waiting achieves nothing, but far too short in production,
// where an idle free-tier host takes the better part of a minute to wake. The
// nav would time out, fall back to empty, and that empty render then sat in the
// cache — a working API serving a category menu that wasn't there.

// build — the exact breakage the deadline was added to prevent.
//
// So the first proven-unreachable request trips this, and every later one fails
