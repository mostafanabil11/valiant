            <h2 className="mb-3 font-heading text-headline-sm font-bold text-foreground">Orders</h2>
            <p>
              Placing an order is an offer to purchase, which we accept once your order is confirmed — by
              email for cash-on-delivery orders, or once payment is confirmed for card orders. Prices are
              listed in Egyptian Pounds (EGP) and include any applicable tax shown at checkout.

            <h2 className="mb-3 font-heading text-headline-sm font-bold text-foreground">Stock &amp; Pricing</h2>
            <p>
              We make every effort to keep stock levels and prices accurate, but an item can occasionally sell
              out between browsing and checkout. If that happens, we&apos;ll never charge you for an item we
              can&apos;t fulfill — your order is blocked from completing until your bag reflects what&apos;s
              actually available.

            <h2 className="mb-3 font-heading text-headline-sm font-bold text-foreground">Payment</h2>
            <p>
              We accept Cash on Delivery and card payments processed securely by Paymob. For card orders, your
              payment is authorized before your order is confirmed; if payment isn&apos;t completed within the
              checkout window, the order is automatically cancelled and nothing is charged.

            <h2 className="mb-3 font-heading text-headline-sm font-bold text-foreground">Cancellations</h2>
            <p>
              You can cancel an order yourself from your order history as long as it hasn&apos;t been paid for
              (cash-on-delivery) or shipped yet. Once an order has shipped, see our{" "}

            <h2 className="mb-3 font-heading text-headline-sm font-bold text-foreground">Coupons &amp; Promotions</h2>
            <p>
              Coupon codes are subject to their own terms (minimum order value, eligible products, expiry date)
              shown when you apply them, and each code may only be redeemed once per customer unless stated
              otherwise.

            <p>
              You&apos;re responsible for keeping your account password confidential and for all activity under
              your account. Contact us immediately if you suspect unauthorized access.
